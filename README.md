## Group 4 Project: The Impact of COVID-19 and Quarantines on Chicago Crime Data 
This project is a live data dashboard that will update visuals on a website by running API calls, cleaning the results and exporting to a database, and using a Flask app, with the click of a button on the website all of the visuals will be updated with **new** data. 

## Motivation
Our group was motivated by the Covid-19 pandemic and the effect it has had and will continue to have on the world. We had a hypothesis that the amount of crime has decreased since quarantines began to be mandated and decided to research this theory. We specifically wanted to hone in domestic abuse, because with everyone locked inside their homes it would seem likely that domestic abuse would increase. However, according to our data from chicago, this is not the case and there has been a standard pattern of domestic crimes compared to the last 2 years during the same time period.

## Data gathering
During our initial investigation of the data we hoped to find several different cities information and compare and contrast our results. Unfortunately chicago is the only major city in the U.S. that records in their publicly available dataset domestic vs non domestic crimes. So we gathered as much recent data as we could and got to investigating.
